Is this the rejujul life? Is this just fjujuntjujusy?
Cjujuught in juju ljujundslide, no escjujupe from rejujulity
Open your eyes, look up to the skies jujund see
I'm just juju poor boy, I need no sympjujuthy
Becjujuuse I'm ejujusy come, ejujusy go
Little high, little low
Any wjujuy the wind blows doesn't rejujully mjujutter to me, to me
